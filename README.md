Exploring Data Visualization in Altair: An Interesting Alternative to Seaborn

**Here is a short FAQ about this repository**

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are going to build various sets of visualizations using Seaborn and Altair libraries in Python and compare them.
The jupyter notebook (.ipynb) provides the code and this read contains all the relevant information about this tutorial.

**2) What is Altair?**

Altair is an open-source data visualization library like Seaborn. Different charts like bar charts, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, line charts, etc. could be generated using Altair.

**3) Which plots have been used for comparison?**

For this tutorial, we have built scatter plots & bubble plots, line charts, bar plots & count plots, histograms, strip plots and interactive plot (only with Altair).

**4) Which dataset has been used?**

The 'milespergallon' or 'mpg' dataset from seaborn datasets library has been used to create the above mentioned plots.

**Details of this tutorial and introduction to Seaborn + Altair have been discussed in my article published on Analytics Vidhya**
